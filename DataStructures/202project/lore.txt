You wake up on a path in a dark and gloomy forest with not a person in sight. The path you're on seems to stretch out in both directions with no end in sight. The brush on either of the side of the path seems too thick to cross through, and the trees seem to tower up to a height too tall to climb to. With no other options, you are forced to choose to go north or south along the path. 
As you continue north, the forest begins to thin out, and a soft glow appears ahead. The path leads you to a serene clearing where sunlight filters through the leaves, illuminating a tranquil pond. Across the pond two paths are laid ahead...
Moving north, the forest grows denser, and the air becomes heavy with an eerie silence. Shadows dance among the trees, and a chill runs down your spine. Suddenly, you stumble upon an ancient, crumbling structure covered in vines. The atmosphere feels ominous, and you sense danger lurking in the shadows. You see two doors into the structure...
You follow the path to the right, drawn by a sense of intuition guiding your steps. As you journey further, the forest seems to come alive with vibrant colors and harmonious melodies. Sunlight dances through the trees, casting a warm glow upon the path ahead. Along the way, you encounter friendly forest creatures who offer guidance and assistance, aiding you on your journey. Eventually, you reach a clearing where you discover a hidden treasure trove, filled with riches beyond your wildest dreams. With a grateful heart and newfound wealth, you emerge from the forest victorious, your quest fulfilled.
Despite the allure of the clearing, you choose the path to the left, ignoring the subtle warning signs hidden beneath the surface. As you venture deeper into the forest, the once tranquil surroundings give way to an eerie silence. Shadows lurk among the trees, and a chill runs down your spine as a sense of foreboding settles over you. The path grows treacherous, with thorny underbrush and tangled roots obstructing your way. With each step, you feel the weight of the forest pressing down upon you, suffocating your spirit. Lost and alone, you realize too late that you've wandered into a realm of darkness from which there is no escape. Your journey ends in defeat, swallowed by the depths of the forest's malevolent embrace.
Despite the ominous atmosphere, you bravely enter the ancient structure through the left door. Inside, you discover a hidden chamber bathed in soft light, filled with ancient tomes and artifacts. As you explore further, you stumble upon a chest tucked away in a corner. With cautious anticipation, you open it to find it filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Gold coins glimmer in the light, and precious gems sparkle with promise. You realize you've stumbled upon a forgotten cache of wealth, and with newfound riches, you emerge from the structure triumphant and victorious.
You cautiously approach the ancient structure and push open the left door, revealing a dark and narrow hallway. The air is thick with dust, and the floor creaks under your weight. As you venture deeper into the darkness, you hear strange whispers echoing off the walls. Suddenly, the floor gives way beneath you, and you plummet into a pit of darkness. The fall knocks the wind out of you, and as you struggle to regain your senses, you realize you've fallen into a trap set by whatever lurks within the structure. Your journey ends here, swallowed by the shadows.
