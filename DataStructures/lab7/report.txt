In your own words, what is the benefit of a recursive solution to
enumerate all of the nqueens potential solutions (2 points):

The benefit of the recursive code is that it can backtrack to previous recursions to find the solution.
Otherwise the backtracking would have had to be manually implemented, which would cause a lot more unnecessary code and 
headache for the developer.

Also in your own words, what are the theoretical and/or practical
advantages of constraining the search space to only still valid
solutions?

The practical advantage of constraining the space is that we do not spend time solving for solutions
that we already know are wrong. This is more helpful when you are coding for n=10-like problems with
over a billion possible solutions. We can easily see that the time was much faster than it was without
the checking as it runs much faster.
