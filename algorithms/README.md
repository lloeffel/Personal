Note these files are a mix of a former class of this instructor at University of Notre Dame and a former class
with the same course objectives taught by Dr. Plank as recently as Fall 2022. Not all of these files are 
guaranteed to be the same as the previous iteration of this course by Dr. Emrich from fall 2021.
