Report:
	This is a nice checkup to see how we are doing on the project. The amount of direction we have on this is not a lot, but it honestly should be that way since we are leading our own projects.

Time Spent: (total: 15 min outside of lab)

	1 hr 15 min: (in lab)
	Downloading Unity and exploring the template for 2D platformers and Unity features
	
	15 min:
	Made the proposal for the project and joined the github repository made by David.

	3hr 45min:
	Watching tutorials and figuring out how unity works. I have never used unity before so I am going to have to start from the ground up in that sense. We have a program that has a sprite in the git repo.
